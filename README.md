***THIS IS A VERY EARLY UPLOAD!***

Don't complain if you don't get any fun out of this.<br>
This contains one very primitive battle. No map, no character, but you should see what I'm trying to do.

If you want to see what I've done, first install python3.8 or higher.
Then `python3 game.py` should do it.
